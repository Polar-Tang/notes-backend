Excellent questions! The `CheckRedirect` function and its parameters, `req *http.Request` and `via []*http.Request`, work together in a very structured way to track redirects and manage them. Let me break it all down to clarify how this magic happens.

---

### **1. How `req *http.Request` Saves the Redirect**

#### **What Is `req *http.Request`?**

- `req *http.Request` is the **new request** that the `http.Client` is about to make after receiving a redirect response (e.g., `301`, `302`).
- This request contains all the necessary information about the redirect target, such as:
    - The **URL** of the new location.
    - Headers (e.g., `User-Agent`, cookies).
    - HTTP method (e.g., `GET`, `POST`).

#### **How Does Go Populate `req`?**

1. When a redirect response (e.g., `301`) is received, the `http.Client` creates a new `*http.Request` object to represent the redirected request.
2. It uses the `Location` header from the redirecting response to set the URL of `req`.

#### **Example Flow:**

Imagine this redirect sequence:

- **Request 1**: `http://example.com` responds with `301 Moved Permanently` to `http://example.com/newpage`.
- **Request 2**: The `http.Client` creates a new `*http.Request` (`req`) with `URL = "http://example.com/newpage"`.
- This new request is passed as the `req` parameter to the `CheckRedirect` function.

---

### **2. How `via []*http.Request` Tracks the Redirect Chain**

#### **What Is `via []*http.Request`?**

- `via` is a **slice** of `*http.Request` objects.
- It represents the **redirect history** leading up to the current request (`req`).

#### **How Does Go Populate `via`?**

1. For each redirect, the `http.Client`:
    
    - Appends the previous request to the `via` slice.
    - Passes the updated slice to the `CheckRedirect` function.
2. This allows you to:
    
    - Inspect all the redirects that have occurred.
    - Decide whether to allow further redirects.

#### **Example Flow:**

- **Request 1**: `http://example.com` redirects to `http://example.com/newpage` (via is `[]`).
- **Request 2**: `http://example.com/newpage` redirects to `http://example.com/finalpage` (via is `[http://example.com]`).
- **Request 3**: No redirect (via is `[http://example.com, http://example.com/newpage]`).

---

### **3. Why the Syntax?**

#### **`func(req *http.Request, via []*http.Request) error`**

- **`req *http.Request`**:
    
    - Passed as a pointer to avoid copying the entire `http.Request` object.
    - You can inspect or modify the redirect request directly (though modifying it is rare).
- **`via []*http.Request`**:
    
    - A slice of pointers to `http.Request` objects, representing the redirect chain.
    - Passed as a slice because the number of redirects is dynamic, and slices are a flexible data structure in Go.

---

### **4. Example in Action**

Letâ€™s walk through an annotated example:

#### Code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	client := &http.Client{
		CheckRedirect: func(req *http.Request, via []*http.Request) error {
			// Print the new request's URL
			fmt.Printf("Redirecting to: %s\n", req.URL)

			// Print the chain of redirects
			fmt.Printf("Redirect chain so far (%d steps):\n", len(via))
			for i, r := range via {
				fmt.Printf("  Step %d: %s\n", i+1, r.URL)
			}

			// Stop after 3 redirects
			if len(via) > 3 {
				return fmt.Errorf("too many redirects")
			}

			return nil // Allow the redirect
		},
	}

	resp, err := client.Get("http://example.com")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error: %v\n", err)
		return
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	fmt.Println("Final URL:", resp.Request.URL)
}
```

#### Output (assuming a multi-step redirect chain):

```plaintext
Redirecting to: http://example.com/newpage
Redirect chain so far (1 steps):
  Step 1: http://example.com
Redirecting to: http://example.com/finalpage
Redirect chain so far (2 steps):
  Step 1: http://example.com
  Step 2: http://example.com/newpage
Final URL: http://example.com/finalpage
```

### **5. Summary**

- **`req *http.Request`**:
    
    - Represents the new request created for the redirect target.
    - Populated based on the `Location` header of the redirecting response.
- **`via []*http.Request`**:
    
    - A slice tracking all previous requests in the redirect chain.
    - Dynamically updated for each redirect.
- **Syntax**:
    
    - The function takes pointers for efficiency and flexibility.
    - `via` as a slice accommodates any number of redirects.
