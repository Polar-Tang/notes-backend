The `LittleEndian` and `BigEndian` options are part of the `binary.ByteOrder` interface, which determines how multi-byte values (like integers) are stored in memory.

- **`LittleEndian`**:
    
    - Stores the least significant byte (LSB) first.
    - For example, the number `0x1234` (4660 in decimal) would be stored as `[0x34, 0x12]`.
    - Often used in x86 and x86-64 architectures (e.g., most PCs and modern servers).
	- If you're working with systems or protocols that require this format.
- **`BigEndian`**:
    - Common in network protocols, which traditionally use "network byte order" (Big Endian).
	- Used in older mainframes and RISC processors (e.g., SPARC).
    - Stores the most significant byte (MSB) first.
    - The same number `0x1234` would be stored as `[0x12, 0x34]`.
