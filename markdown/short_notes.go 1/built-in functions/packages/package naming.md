By _convention_, a package's name is the same as the last element of its import path. For instance, the `math/rand` package comprises files that begin with:
```go
package rand
```
That said, package names aren't _required_ to match their import path. For example, I could write a new package with the path `github.com/mailio/rand` and name the package `random`:
```go
package random
```
