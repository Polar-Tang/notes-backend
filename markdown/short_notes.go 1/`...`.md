**In Function Signatures:**

- `func myFunc(args ...int)`: This accept varaibles of type integers, it could be even a slice of integers

**2. Slicing:**

- `s[i...]`: This creates a slice of the elements of `s` from index `i` to the end.

**3. Spread Operator (with caution):**
- You could use the spread operator to spread the elements fr4om slice like a single arguments
	```go
	nums := []int{1, 2, 3}
	myFunc(nums...)
	```
