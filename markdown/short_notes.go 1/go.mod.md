Go mod it's where we save all the modules that we use in on own dependencies, but also our [[markdown/short_notes.go 1/module]] by itself. It's similar to the package JSON in JavaScript.
I use `go mod` with the init option to initialize the mod file, and then the name of our module we are creating, as follows:
```sh
go mod init example/hello
```
