>*"ToÂ [allocate](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/allocate)" means to assign, allot, distribute, or "set apart for a particular purpose."* Programs manage their memory by partitioning or dividing it into separate regions that perform specific tasks. Two of those regions are the stack and the heap. When a program needs memory for data or variables, it allocates it from the stack or heap. It deallocates the memory when it's no longer needed, returning it to the allocating region where it is again available for allocation.
