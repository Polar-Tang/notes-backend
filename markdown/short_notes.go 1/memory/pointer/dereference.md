Generally speaking mostly of the values in go are passed by value. meaning the value ogf the variable get copied and the original it's not modified:
```go
func increment(x int) {
    x++
    fmt.Println(x)
    // 6
}


func main() {
    x := 5
    increment(x)
    fmt.Println(x)
    // 5
}
```
X remains as 5 in the main function because increment only change a copy of x.
But thanks to the pointer we use the same place in the memmory so we alter directly that variable allocation
