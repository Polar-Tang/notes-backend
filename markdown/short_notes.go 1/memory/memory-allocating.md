The data has an address in the memory, if you got {4,5,3} this already has a predefined length, and then you do `append(slice,6)` it will allocate offside the slice. So you should do a `make(slice,6)`  to already have all of these addresses.
To point to the same address we use a [[markdown/short_notes.go 1/memory/pointer/pointer]]
