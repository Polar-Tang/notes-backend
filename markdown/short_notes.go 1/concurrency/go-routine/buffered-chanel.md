We could create a buffer length, by providing a second argument to make
```go
ch := make(chan int, 100)
```
This means that this channel will have 100 process concurrent

#### Example
```go
func addEmailsToQueue(emails []string) chan string {
    c := make(chan string, len(emails))
    
    for _, email := range emails {
        c <- email
    }
    
    return c
}
```
We create the channel with the length of the emails, and then will be populated with an array
