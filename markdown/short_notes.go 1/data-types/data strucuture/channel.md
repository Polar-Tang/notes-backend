#### **(e) Channels**

- Used for safe communication between goroutines.
- Not typically used for general data storage but essential for concurrent programs.

##### Example:

```go
// Create a channel
ch := make(chan int, 2)

// Insert (send) data
ch <- 10
ch <- 20

// Retrieve (receive) data
value := <-ch // 10
fmt.Println(value)
```

The arrow operator `<-` is used for **sending** and **receiving** values on a channel.

1. **Sending to a Channel**:
    
    ```go
    ch <- value
    ```
    
    - Sends `value` into the channel `ch`.
    - Blocks if the channel is full (for buffered channels).
2. **Receiving from a Channel**:
    
    ```go
    value := <-ch
    ```
    
    - Receives a value from the channel `ch`.
    - Blocks if the channel is empty.
3. **Example**:
    
    ```go
    ch := make(chan int, 1) // Buffered channel with capacity 1
    ch <- 10                // Send value into channel
    fmt.Println(<-ch)       // Receive value from channel (prints 10)
    ```
    
4. **Closing a Channel**:
    
    ```go
    close(ch)
    ```
    
    - Signals that no more values will be sent on the channel.
    - Receivers can detect this with a second value:
        
        ```go
        value, ok := <-ch
        if !ok {
            fmt.Println("Channel closed")
        }
        ```
