Here are the primary data structures Go supports natively:

|**Data Structure**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Arrays**|Fixed-size sequences of elements of the same type.|
|**Slices**|Dynamic, flexible versions of arrays (most commonly used).|
|**Maps**|Key-value pairs with fast lookup.|
|**Structs**|Custom composite data types for grouping fields (similar to objects in other languages).|
|**Channels**|Concurrency-safe communication between goroutines (used with `go` routines for concurrent programming).|
