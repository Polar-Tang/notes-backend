An anonymous struct is a struct which is declared without a name:
```go
myCar := struct {
  brand string
  model string
}{
  brand: "tesla",
  model: "model 3",
}
```
That's defined and right then it's initialized. It makes sense if i want to use the struct a single time. Although i can rassign it a name `myCar := ...`
