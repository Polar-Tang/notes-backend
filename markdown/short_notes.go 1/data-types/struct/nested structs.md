Nested structs are literal structs inside another structs.
```go
type Config struct { 
	Address string 
	Options struct { 
		Timeout int 
	} 
}
```
And can be initialized using [[composite_literals]]
```go
cfg := Config{
    Address: "localhost",
    Options: struct {
        Timeout int
    }{
        Timeout: 30,
    },
}

```
