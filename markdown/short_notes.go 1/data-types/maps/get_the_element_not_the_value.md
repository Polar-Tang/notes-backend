**Analogy:**

Imagine a dictionary.

- **Key:** The word (e.g., "cat")
- **Value:** The definition of the word ("a small domesticated carnivorous mammal with soft fur, a short snout, and retractable claws.")

When you look up "cat" in the dictionary, you're not just accessing the word itself, you're accessing the definition associated with that word.

In the case of `validUsers[message]++`:

- You're looking up the `message` (e.g., "cersei") in the map.
- This gives you the current count of messages sent by "cersei" (e.g., 2).
- You increment that count (2 + 1 = 3).
- You update the map entry for "cersei" to reflect the new count (3).

I hope this explanation clarifies why `validUsers[message]++` works as expected and how it correctly accumulates the message counts for each user in your map.
