A slice literal is the same that array literal but without the length
```go
[3]bool{true, true, false}
```

And this creates the same array as above, then builds a slice that references it:
```go
[]bool{true, true, false}
```

Is mostly used to initialize the values inside the slice
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	s := []struct {
		i int
		b bool
	}{
		{2, true},
		{3, false},
		{5, true},
		{7, true},
		{11, false},
		{13, true},
	}
	fmt.Println(s)
}
```
In this example we declare and initialize a struct, using [[Walrus_operator]] to initialize and declare at the same time, later gives the value
