Early return in Go allows a function to exit as soon as a specific condition is met, just like React does
Instead of use if/else chains create condition that were evaluated until the function ends:
```go
func divide(dividend, divisor int) (int, error) {
	if divisor == 0 {
		return 0, errors.New("Can't divide by zero")
	}
	return dividend/divisor, nil
}
```
