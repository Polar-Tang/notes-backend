We may to apply certain function to a certain type, that's why we got the contraints.
For example we want to apply the concat method which only works with strings, maybe is not a string but we could force to a string value, such as we do with the runes:
```go
type stringer interface {
    String() string
}

func concat[T stringer](vals []T) string {
    result := ""
    for _, val := range vals {
        // this is where the .String() method
        // is used. That's why we need a more specific
        // constraint instead of the any constraint
        result += val.String()
    }
    return result
}
```
