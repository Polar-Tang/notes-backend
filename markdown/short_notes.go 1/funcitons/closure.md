Closure are inner functions that are returned by outer functions.
Imagine we got a function that returns another function
```go
func concatter() func(string) string {
	doc := ""
	return func(word string) string {
		doc += word + " "
		return doc
	}
}
```
The doc is an accumulator which is not possible to access outside the function

```go
func main() {
	harryPotterAggregator := concatter()
	harryPotterAggregator("Mr.")
}
```
Now if we call that same function, this will be executed, and it will redefine the doc value and use the doc variable.
