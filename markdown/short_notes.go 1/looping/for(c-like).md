This is the for of c style, and it's the only one for looping.

The basicÂ `for`Â loop has three components separated by semicolons:

- the init statement: executed before the first iteration
- the condition expression: evaluated before every iteration
- the post statement: executed at the end of every iteration

You're diving into a fascinating part of Go's syntax and logic! Let's take it piece by piece to make everything crystal clear. ðŸ’¡

### The For Loop: Initialization, Condition, Post-Step

This part may seem tricky at first, but itâ€™s a standard Go **for loop** syntax.

```go
for i, j := 0, len(r)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
    r[i], r[j] = r[j], r[i]
}
```

Letâ€™s break it down:

#### a) Initialization: `i, j := 0, len(r)-1`

- `i` is the index starting at the beginning of the slice (`0`).
- `j` is the index starting at the end of the slice (`len(r)-1`).

#### b) Condition: `i < j`

- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `j`.
- This ensures the swapping process stops when `i` and `j` meet (or cross) in the middle.

#### c) Post-Step: `i, j = i+1, j-1`

- After each iteration:
    - `i` is incremented (`i+1`) to move toward the end of the slice.
    - `j` is decremented (`j-1`) to move toward the start of the slice.

This two-pointer approach is efficient for reversing a sequence because we only iterate halfway through the slice.

### The Core Logic: Swapping Runes

Inside the loop, this line does the magic:

```go
r[i], r[j] = r[j], r[i]
```

This **swaps the values at indices `i` and `j`**. For example:

1. Suppose `r` initially looks like this (for the word "Hello"):
    
    ```
    r = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
         i                 j
    ```
    
2. On the first iteration:
    
    - Swap `r[i]` and `r[j]` (i.e., `'H'` and `'o'`):
        
        ```
        r = ['o', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'H']
            i    ->        <-     j
        ```
        
3. Move the pointers (`i++` and `j--`):
    
    ```
    r = ['o', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'H']
              i      j
    ```
    
4. On the second iteration:
    
    - Swap `r[i]` and `r[j]` (i.e., `'e'` and `'l'`):
        
        ```
        r = ['o', 'l', 'l', 'e', 'H']
                    i j
        ```
        
5. Stop the loop when `i == j` (middle of the slice).

### 4. After the Loop: Returning the Reversed String

After the loop finishes:

```go
return string(r)
```

- `string(r)` converts the slice of runes back into a string.
- The reversed string is returned to the caller.

### Example Walkthrough

Hereâ€™s the entire process for reversing `"Hello"`:

1. Input: `"Hello"`
2. Convert to runes: `['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']`
3. Reverse:
    - Swap `'H'` with `'o'`.
    - Swap `'e'` with `'l'`.
4. Resulting runes: `['o', 'l', 'l', 'e', 'H']`
5. Convert back to string: `"olleH"`
