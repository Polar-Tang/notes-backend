As go only has a `for` loop we should do many of the other loop thing by only using for. As we could [[markdown/short_notes.go 1/looping/omiting statements]] a while is just a for that only has a condition:
```go
for CONDITION {
  // do some stuff while CONDITION is true
}
``` 
#### For example
```go
plantHeight := 1
for plantHeight < 5 {
  fmt.Println("still growing! current height:", plantHeight)
  plantHeight++
}
fmt.Println("plant has grown to ", plantHeight, "inches")
```
