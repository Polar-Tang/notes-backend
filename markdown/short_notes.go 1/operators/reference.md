`=` You save a value in a name, and you need to type the value
```go
var number int // Declared but not initialized
number = 42    // Later assigned
```
`:=` You save the value an use it as the initial value, and you don't need to type the value.
```go
var number := 42    // You declare a number and initialize it
```
You canâ€™t use `:=` outside of functions (like at the package level). For global variables, you must use `var`.
