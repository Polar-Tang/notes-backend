- **Separating short variable declarations from conditions** (as seen in the `if` statement above).
- **Ending statements:** While semicolons are optional at the end of lines in Go, the compiler inserts them automatically during parsing.
```go
if variable := someFunction(); condition(variable) {
	// Code block if condition is true
}
```
The `;` separates the variable declaration
