- **IND** the cyphertext should have Indistinguishability, it should look random
- **NM**, non-maleability

### Examples
##### Semantical Secure
IND-CPA, also know as semantical secure, is a security principle which says that the same plaintext with the same cypher should return a different cyphertext. to achive this we could randomize the encryption.
imagine an attacker got two plain text and one cypher text, so the attacker has Ci = E(K, Pi).  Thereby the cypher could be applied to determine what is C:
C1 = E(K, P1) and C2 = E(K, P2).
To generate this random value we could use a bit random generator:
E(K, R, P) = (DRBG(K R) ⊕ P, R)
