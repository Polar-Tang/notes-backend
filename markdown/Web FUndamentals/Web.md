DNS is the "Domain Name System" which turn an IP from a server into an arbitrary name. BUt it also resolve to IPv4 addresses, for example 104.26.10.229, resolve to IPv6 addresses, for example 2606:4700:20::681a:be5, CNAME, which is a redirect but in the DNS layer, 

And txt, which is the layer in charge of handle emails and identify the spam

### **Top-level domain**
TLD is the part that we can find in the righ-hand of the segment. It means "Top Level Domain" and that is call because it is in the higher hierarchy from the DNS protocol. There are two types of TLD, gTLD (Generic Top Level) and ccTLD (Country Code Top Level Domain). 
#### gTLD
to tell the user the domain name's purpose; for example, a .com would be for commercial purposes, .org for an organisation, .edu for education and .gov for government. 
Historically a gTLD was meant 
#### ccTLD
And a ccTLD was used for geographical purposes, for example, .ca for sites based in Canada, .co.uk for sites based in the United Kingdom and so on. Due to such demand, there is an influx of new gTLDs ranging from .online , .club , .website , .biz and so many more.

### **Second-Level Domain**
the second-level domain is limited to 63 characters + the TLD and can only use a-z 0-9 and hyphens (cannot start or end with hyphens or have consecutive hyphens).

### Subdomain
 You can use multiple subdomains split with periods to create longer names, such as [jupiter.servers.tryhackme.com](http://jupiter.servers.tryhackme.com/). But the length must be kept to 253 characters or less. There is no limit to the number of subdomains you can create for your domain name.
