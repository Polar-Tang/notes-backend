# TS Data Structure
TypeScript supports a wide variety of data structures, many of which are inherited from JavaScript, but with the added benefit of TypeScript's static typing. Below is a list of the primary data structures supported by TypeScript:
TypeScript supports a wide variety of data structures, many of which are inherited from JavaScript, but with the added benefit of TypeScript's static typing. Below is a list of the primary data structures supported by TypeScript:
## Ts Data types
### **1. Primitives**

These are the basic data types in TypeScript:

- **`number`**: For both integers and floating-point numbers.
  ```typescript
  let num: number = 42;
  ```
- **`string`**: Represents text data.
  ```typescript
  let str: string = "Hello, World!";
  ```
- **`boolean`**: For `true` or `false` values.
  ```typescript
  let isDone: boolean = false;
  ```
- **`bigint`**: Represents large integers.
  ```typescript
  let big: bigint = 100n;
  ```
- **`symbol`**: A unique value, often used as keys in objects.
  ```typescript
  let sym: symbol = Symbol("unique");
  ```
- **`null`** and **`undefined`**: Represent the absence of a value.
  ```typescript
  let nothing: null = null;
  let notDefined: undefined = undefined;
  ```

### **2. Arrays**

An array is a collection of elements of a specific type. There are two ways to declare an array:

- **Simple array**:
  ```typescript
  let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
  ```
- **Generic array**:
  ```typescript
  let fruits: Array<string> = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
  ```

### **3. Tuples**

Tuples are fixed-length arrays where each element has a specific type. They can also have optional or rest elements.

- **Basic tuple**:
  ```typescript
  let tuple: [string, number] = ["age", 25];
  ```
- **Tuple with optional element**:
  ```typescript
  let optionalTuple: [string, number?] = ["age"];
  ```

### **4. Objects**

Objects in TypeScript are used to represent key-value pairs, and you can define the structure of an object using **interfaces** or **type aliases**.

- **Object literal**:
  ```typescript
  let person: { name: string; age: number } = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
  };
  ```

- **Using an interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
  }
  let alice: Person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
  ```

### **5. Maps**

A `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs, where keys and values can be of any type.

- **Map example**:
  ```typescript
  let map = new Map<string, number>();
  map.set("one", 1);
  map.set("two", 2);
  ```

### **6. Sets**

A `Set` is a collection of unique values. Each value may occur only once.

- **Set example**:
  ```typescript
  let set = new Set<number>();
  set.add(1);
  set.add(2);
  set.add(2); // Duplicate, won't be added again.
  ```

### **7. `Record` Utility Type**

`Record<K, T>` is a TypeScript utility type that creates an object type with keys of type `K` and values of type `T`.

- **Record example**:
  ```typescript
  let userScores: Record<string, number> = {
    Alice: 95,
    Bob: 85,
  };
  ```

### **8. Enums**

Enums allow you to define a set of named constants, which can be either **numeric** or **string** enums.

- **Numeric Enum**:
  ```typescript
  enum Direction {
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right,
  }
  let dir: Direction = Direction.Up;
  ```

- **String Enum**:
  ```typescript
  enum Color {
    Red = "RED",
    Green = "GREEN",
    Blue = "BLUE",
  }
  ```

### **9. `WeakMap` and `WeakSet`**

- **WeakMap**: Similar to `Map`, but the keys must be objects, and they are weakly referenced, meaning they can be garbage-collected if there are no other references to them.
  ```typescript
  let weakMap = new WeakMap<object, string>();
  let obj = {};
  weakMap.set(obj, "value");
  ```

- **WeakSet**: Similar to `Set`, but it can only hold objects, and they are weakly referenced.
  ```typescript
  let weakSet = new WeakSet<object>();
  let obj2 = {};
  weakSet.add(obj2);
  ```

### **10. Functions**

Functions are also treated as first-class objects in TypeScript, meaning they can be passed around as values. You can specify parameter types and return types:

- **Function declaration**:
  ```typescript
  function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  }
  ```

- **Arrow function**:
  ```typescript
  const multiply = (x: number, y: number): number => x * y;
  ```

### **11. Union and Intersection Types**

- **Union types**: A variable can hold one of several types.
  ```typescript
  let value: string | number;
  value = "hello";
  value = 123;
  ```

- **Intersection types**: Combine multiple types into one.
  ```typescript
  type A = { a: string };
  type B = { b: number };
  let ab: A & B = { a: "hello", b: 123 };
  ```

### **12. `any` and `unknown`**

- **`any`**: A type that disables type-checking, allowing any type of value.
  ```typescript
  let anything: any = "hello";
  anything = 123;
  ```

- **`unknown`**: Similar to `any`, but safer because you must perform type checks before using it.
  ```typescript
  let something: unknown = "hello";
  if (typeof something === "string") {
    console.log(something.toUpperCase());
  }
  ```

### **13. `void`, `null`, and `undefined`**

- **`void`**: Typically used for functions that do not return anything.
  ```typescript
  function logMessage(): void {
    console.log("This function doesn't return anything");
  }
  ```

- **`null`**: Represents an explicitly absent value.
  ```typescript
  let empty: null = null;
  ```

- **`undefined`**: Represents a value that hasn't been assigned.
  ```typescript
  let uninitialized: undefined = undefined;
  ```

### **14. `never`**

- **`never`** is a type that represents values that never occur, such as a function that never returns.
  ```typescript
  function throwError(message: string): never {
    throw new Error(message);
  }
  ```

### **15. Generics**

Generics allow creating data structures that can work with different types.

- **Generic Array**:
  ```typescript
  function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
  }
  ```

### **16. Classes and Interfaces**

Classes are used to define data structures and behavior together.

- **Class**:
  ```typescript
  class Person {
    name: string;
    constructor(name: string) {
      this.name = name;
    }
  }
  ```

- **Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface Car {
    make: string;
    model: string;
  }
  ```
### **Summary**:

TypeScript supports a wide variety of data structures, including primitives, objects, arrays, tuples, enums, sets, maps, and more. It also allows for advanced type manipulation with features like unions, intersections, generics, and utility types (`Record`, `Partial`, etc.). This flexibility allows TypeScript to model many different programming paradigms and handle complex data structures with strong typing.
