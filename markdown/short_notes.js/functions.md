# Functions
**def**
	set of statemens that perform a task or calculate a value that comes fron an input and give you an output. To use a function you need to call somewhere from the scope you wish to call
### parameters
A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. If the function chhange de paramte's properties these change globally
```ts
function myFunc(theArr) {
  theArr[0] = 30;
}

const arr = [45];

console.log(arr[0]); // 45
myFunc(arr);
console.log(arr[0]); // 30

```

### Also functions can be defined as a [function expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function)
```ts
const square = function (number) {
  return number * number;
};

console.log(square(4)); // 16

```
These have their own this context

### Arrow function
```ts
const getRectArea2 = (width: number, height: number) => width * height;
```

### Callback fn
A **callback function** is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked by the outer function to perform a task.
### IIFE
An **IIFE** is a function that **invokes itself automatically** right after its definition
**syntax:**
```
(function () {
  // Code here runs immediately
})();
```
- The parentheses around the function declaration `(function() {...})` tell JavaScript to treat it as an expression.
- The `()` at the end invokes the function **immediately**.
# Try.... catch
Try is a function to execute, if no exeptions occurs catch is skipped
**`finally`** (optional): The code inside the `finally` block runs regardless of whether an error occurred or not. It's useful for cleanup actions (e.g., closing resources).
# JavaScript
## Symbol
newer data type primitive which is inmutable and isn't repeateble
**Well-known symbols**
they are built-in functions to customize the symbol behaviour
- **`Symbol.iterator`**: Defines the default iterator for an object.
- **`Symbol.toStringTag`**: Allows you to customize the default string description of an object.
- **`Symbol.hasInstance`**: Customizes how `instanceof` behaves for objects.

## Logic Operators
the increment&decrement operator can only be applied to a **variable** or a **property** that can actually store values.
# Array methods
#### **findIndex()**
The method findIndex() returned the first item index that satisface the provided prove, otherwise this method return -1
#### **filter()**
create a shallow copy of the elements that pass the test. The correct syntax for `.filter()` requires a **callback function** that will be executed for each element of the array that returns true or false
```js
const words = ['spray', 'elite', 'exuberant', 'destruction', 'present'];

const result = words.filter((word) => word.length > 6);

console.log(result);
// Expected output: Array ["exuberant", "destruction", "present"]
```
