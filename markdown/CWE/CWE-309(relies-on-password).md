When you use password-based systems as the primary authentication method, you are doing a single mechanism to validate an important function such as [[markdown/Portswigger/Autenthication/authentication|authentication]] and this password mechanism could lead to several security flaws

- Storing passwords in plaintext rather than hashing them exposes user data if the database is compromised.
- Phishing attacks trick users into revealing their passwords.
