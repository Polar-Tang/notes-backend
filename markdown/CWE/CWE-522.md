The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.

##### Example
This code changes the user password:
```php
$user = $_GET['user'];  
$pass = $_GET['pass'];  
$checkpass = $_GET['checkpass'];  
if ($pass == $checkpass) {

SetUserPassword($user, $pass);

}
```
It's just checking that the user is introduced password is the same, but isn't confirming that the user changing the password is the same who owns the account.
