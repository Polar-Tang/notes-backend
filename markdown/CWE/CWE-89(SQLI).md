The application constructs all or a part of a SQL command using and external influenced input, but it doesn't neutralize or incorrectly neutralize special elements that could modify the intended SQL command

##### Example
This query search for certain component 
```sql
SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = <userName> AND itemname = <itemName>;
```
As this is concatenating user commands to a constant base query string, the query only works if the user name parameter doesn't have a single quote. So by controlling the userName parameter an attacker could introduce an input to search for all the users.
```sql
name' OR 'a'='a
```
