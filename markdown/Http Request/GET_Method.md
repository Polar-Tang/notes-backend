GET is used as degault to get the resource hosted in the url we visited. After that the browser used to send another request. 
#### Exercise
In the exercise it carries a **basic HTTP authentication**
If we access directly at the page, using the i flags to see the header, then we got access denied:
```shell
curl -i http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/
```
But if we provide the credentials using `-u` flag, we cain gain access to the response
Also we could use the following sintax to provide the credentials: `username:password@URL`,

```shell
 curl http://admin:admin@<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/
```
>`@` separates credentials from the host address. This format follows the general URI scheme and allows for credentials to be embedded directly in the URL for basic access authentication (although it’s not recommended for sensitive or secure data)

As the token session is the basic we should use the -H parameter to send that as a header
```shell
curl -H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=' http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/
```
###### Once in the page
Once we logen there's a functionallity `sarchcity`, and when we look for a city it is a paramete of a get method  `/search.php?search=le`, so visualize that request in the network tab, right click, and copy as a curl command
```shell
 curl 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/search.php?search=le' -H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4='
```
Also we could rigth click but to select "copy as a fetch" and paste that on the console from the browser, and then send it
