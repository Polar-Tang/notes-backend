GET is used as degault to get the resource hosted in the url we visited. After that the browser used to send another request. 
#### Exercise
In the exercise it carries a **basic HTTP authentication**
If we access directly at the page, using the i flags to see the header, then we got access denied:
```shell
curl -i http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/
```
But if we provide the credentials using `-u` flag, we cain gain access to the response
Also we could use the following sintax to provide the credentials: `username:password@URL`
```shell
 curl http://admin:admin@<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/
```
As the token session is the basic we should use the -H parameter to send that as a header
```shell
curl -H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=' http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/
```
###### Once in the page
Once we logen there's a functionallity `sarchcity`, and when we look for a city it is a paramete of a get method  `/search.php?search=le`, so visualize that request in the network tab, right click, and copy as a curl command
```shell
 curl 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/search.php?search=le' -H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4='
```
Also we could rigth click but to select "copy as a fetch" and paste that on the console from the browser, and then send it
