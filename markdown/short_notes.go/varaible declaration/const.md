Constants are variable that its value will never be changed, so instead of var, this is a variable that not vary.
They just can be the default [[data_types]], and they must be known at the compile time, which means we cannot use the [[Walrus_operator]] to initialize it and declare in the same line
They're useful for values that you know will never change, like mathematical constants, fixed strings, or configuration keys.

Here’s how you declare a constant in Go:

```go
const Pi = 3.14159
const Greeting = "Hello, World"
const MaxUsers = 100
```

- Constants must be initialized at the time of declaration (no lazy initialization).
- They can only be a basic type like `string`, `bool`, `int`, or `float`.

If you try to reassign a constant, Go will throw a compile-time error:

```go
Pi = 3.14 // ERROR: cannot assign to Pi
```

You can also group constants together like this:

```go
const (
    Pi       = 3.14159
    Greeting = "Hello, World"
    MaxUsers = 100
)
```

A constant in go should be unmutable, so if we try to apply this to something like a slice (`[]string`) it will retrieve an error
