### Composite litelars
We could declare the array as [[markdown/short_notes.go/data-types/composite_literals]]
We could aclare the values in order to their indexes:
```go
arr := [5]int{0: 1, 1: 2, 3: 4} // [1, 2, 0, 4, 0]
```
You also could use the ... notation so go goes to infer the quantity of index:
```go
arr := [...]int{1, 2, 3} // Length is 3
```
But this doesn't mean that array will always require a to declare a explicit length:
```go
slice := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
```
