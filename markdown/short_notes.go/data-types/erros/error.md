AN error is a data type, with a built-in interface:
```go
type error interface {
    Error() string
}
```
An error is explicit returned by functions, like [[strconv]] and many others


So the error are just interfaces, that's the reason why you could personalize your own interface of error.
```go
type userError struct {
    name string
}

func (e userError) Error() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%v has a problem with their account", e.name)
}
```
And this be'll called.
```go
func sendSMS(msg, userName string) error {
    if !canSendToUser(userName) {
        return userError{name: userName}
    }
    ...
}
```
Use [[errors.new]] to create a personalized error message
