it's used to accept an undefined quantity of something.
#### For example
```go
func concat(strs ...string) string
```
This could concatenate zero or more types, so whatever quantity you pass to the function it will accept it
We could use [[append]] to dinamically add some content

If i do not have a variadic i should create a for to iterate and search all over the thing.
```go
func printStrings(strings []string) {
    for i := 0; i < len(strings); i++ {
        fmt.Println(strings[i])
    }
}

printStrings([]string{"bob", "sue", "alice"}) // Always pass a slice
```
But with this i could print the things more easily:
```go
names := []string{"bob", "sue", "alice"}
printStrings(names...)
```
