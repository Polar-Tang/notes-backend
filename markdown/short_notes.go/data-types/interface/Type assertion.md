An empty interfece could represnet any value, but to use the value as a specific type you must assert its type implicilty
```go
value := interfaceVariable.(Type)
```
- `interfaceVariable` is the variable of type `interface{}`.
- `Type` is the concrete type you want to extract.
If the `interfaceVariable` holds the asserted type, the type assertion succeeds, and you get the value as that type.

#### Example
```go
var i interface{} = "hello"
s := i.(string)
fmt.Println(s)
```
The "`i`" variable holds the "hello" string, and the s variable is doing an assertion. If i it's a string s holds that value.
So we could use now the [[Identity (Ok)]] to check it existence, otherwise it will CRASH
```go
s, ok := i.(string) // Output: hello true
fmt.Println(s, ok)
```
#### Example using type assertion
Use if statements using the ok idiom could be really uncomfortable, that's the reason why we may want to use an swith instead:
```go
func printNumericValue(num interface{}) {
	switch v := num.(type) {
	case int:
		fmt.Printf("%T\n", v) // v is an int
	case string:
		fmt.Printf("%T\n", v) // v is a string
	default:
		fmt.Printf("%T\n", v) // v is something else
	}
}
```
