Maps are mcuh faster than slice. When you check for an item on a slice it should check for every element, comparing if that exist. 
Using the **O(1)**: **Constant Time** calculation, which compute the timing that an algorithm last to do something, on the othen hand **O(n)**: **Linear Time** calculate the time consume depending on the input size
### Slices
Slice are **O(n)**: **Linear Time**, which mean it may late more or less in function on the input size
```go
for _, contact := range phoneBook {
    if contact.name == "Alice" {
        fmt.Println(contact.phone)
    }
}
```
It is checking for 
- If `phoneBook` has 10 entries, Go might need to check 10 items.
- If `phoneBook` has 1,000,000 entries, Go might need to check 1,000,000 items.
### Maps
The maps instead is saving hashing bound to the value key pair, and Go finds this hash pretty quickly
```go
phoneBook := map[string]string{
    "Alice": "123-456",
    "Bob":   "789-101",
}
```
- Now`"Alice"` might hash to memory location `0x1A2B`.
