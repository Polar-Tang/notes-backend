Points could be faster, but don't use them for everything.
1. First, worry about writing clear, correct, maintainable code.
2. If you have a performance problem, fix it.

**If you _do_ have a performance problem, consider:**

1. [Stack vs. Heap](https://go.dev/doc/faq#stack_or_heap)
2. Copying
When you declare a pointer, you're essentially creating a variable that stores a memory address.
But actually [[stack-memory]] used to be faster than [[heap-memory]].
