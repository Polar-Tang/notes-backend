Don't forget 
The post method, just like get, it's wrapped  in a [NewRequestWithContext](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#NewRequestWithContext) 
```go
req, err := http.NewRequest("POST", url, bytes.NewBuffer(jsonData) )
```
Return the response and an error, we should specify the following args in the http new request, The method, the url, and the body response.
The we should use our [[http client]] directly referencing its adress to actually change it
```go
client := &http.Client{}
```
