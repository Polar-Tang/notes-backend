map is used to declare a key-value pair, like the dictionary in python or the objects in javascript.
Usually the key must be a string, but iyou could force them when you type that. the syntax goes like: `map[key_data_type]value_data_type`, right?

```go
myMap := map[string]int{"Alice": 25, "Bob": 30}
```
```go
ages := map[string]int{
    "Alice": 25,
    "Bob":   30,
}
```
You can also use **structs** as values or create more complex combinations:
```go
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

people := map[int]Person{
    1: {Name: "Alice", Age: 25},
    2: {Name: "Bob", Age: 30},
}
```
So you could force the type of the key, but this is not a simple key,Go computes a **hash value** from the key to  differences certain data to other, The hash determines where the value is stored in memory, so it could not be declared as any data type
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Valid keys
    m := map[string]int{"Alice": 25}
    fmt.Println(m)

    // Invalid keys (will throw errors)
    // var invalidMap = map[[]int]int{}  // ERROR: slice as key
}

```
