Anonymous functions in Go are functions without a name. They are defined inline and can be invoked immediately. They are commonly used with goroutines, like in your example:
```go
go func(url string) {
    // Function body
}(url)
```
Declares a [[Goroutine]] which recives an argument, and the argument from the last is calling this anonymous function and passing the argument value
