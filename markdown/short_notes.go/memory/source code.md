The machine don't understand the human language, they use binary instead, also know as machine code, which are basically the instructions of what the computer should do.
The size from a machine code may vary from a computer to another. *32-bit instructions are still in use, but 64-bit instructions are now the most common.*
When a program runs in a OS, (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.), the OS acts as a host environment that provides services to the program, and how this access to a hardware (e.g. keyboard, mouse) may vary.

#### High level language
As write in machine code is slow and tedious, we use high-level languages that focus more on less on the system running the program. As the machine could not understand these language it utilizes a [[compiler]]
