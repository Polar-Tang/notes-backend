**Telemetry** is the automated collection, transmission, and analysis of data to monitor, debug, or optimize systems, applications, and devices. Telemetry data helps developers and organizations gain insights into the performance, errors, and usage patterns of their systems.
They are
1. **Application logs**: Written to capture, events, debugging information, or application errors
	-  **Extensions**: `log`, `txt`, `json`, or `db` files.
	- Stack traces with file names, line numbers, and error messages.
	- User actions like `UserID: 123 clicked Button A`.
	- Data like HTTP request/response payloads or API errors.
2. **Crash dumps**: Automatically generated when an apllication crashes
	-  `.dmp` (Windows crash dumps).
    - `.log` (text-based crash info).
    - `.dat`, `.stacktrace`, or binary blobs.
	- **Examples**: Stack frames, function names, and variable states.
3. **Stack trace**: show the chain of function calls that led to an error or crash.
	-  Logs, console outputs, error blobs.
	- May tell you file path, code function, and a little bit of application logic
4. **Performance metrics**: Measure how well an application performs (latency, uptime, resource usage).
	- Found it in Logs, `.csv`, or `.db` tables.
	- **Examples**:
		- HTTP response time logs.
		- API call metrics: `200 OK in 112ms`.
		- CPU or memory usage: `Memory: 78%`.
5. **Configuration data**: application configurations and settings at runtime.
	 - JSON, XML, `.ini`, `.cfg`, or `.yaml` files.
6. **Data Telemetry**: Logs of user actions, payments, transactions, or database operations.
	- `.csv`, `.json`, `.db` files.

### **How You Can Use Telemetry Artifacts**

1. **Stack Traces**:
    
    - Extract file names, paths, and function names to understand internal systems.
    - Look for exposed hardcoded credentials in function variables.
2. **Logs and Text Blobs**:
    
    - Search for sensitive terms: `password`, `api_key`, `secret`, `token`.
    - Look for debug logs with environment details.
3. **Databases**:
    
    - Explore SQLite `.db` files for table contents, even if partially populated.
4. **Crash Dumps**:
    
    - Extract memory data using tools like **WinDbg**, **gdb**, or **strings**.
5. **Telemetry Config Files**:
    
    - Investigate any misconfigured telemetry endpoints (e.g., sending logs to external domains).
