A module it's a collection of packages saved in repositories

go mod init example/hello

When you move your files, Go treats the folder as a new project, so you’ll need to:

1. **Initialize a New Module**: Run `go mod init` with the desired module name inside the `exercise3` folder:
```sh
cd exercise3
go mod init example.com/exercise3
```
So the modules are handled by packages, anyway supose you got a folder inside:
```tree
exercise3/
├── main.go
├── utils/
│   └── helpers.go
```
You should initialize it with a mod,
```sh
cd exercise3
go mod init exercise3
```
 so later we'll use that package name, with the folder name:
 ```go
 package main

import (
    "exercise3/utils"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Calling a helper function!")
    utils.HelperFunction()
}
```
