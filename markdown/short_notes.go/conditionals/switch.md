Switch statements are a way to compare a value against multiple options. They are similar to if-else statements but are more concise and readable when the number of options is more than 2.
We don't use "break" if you don't want a case to fall through the next use "faltlthrough" 
```go
func getCreator(os string) string {
    var creator string
    switch os {
    case "linux":
        creator = "Linus Torvalds"
    case "windows":
        creator = "Bill Gates"

    // all three of these cases will set creator to "A Steve"
    case "Mac OS":
        fallthrough
    case "Mac OS X":
        fallthrough
    case "mac":
        creator = "A Steve"

    default:
        creator = "Unknown"
    }
    return creator
}
```
