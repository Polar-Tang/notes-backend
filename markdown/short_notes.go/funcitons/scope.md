When a variable it's defined outside any function it means that is used globally, so it's available in all the package. That's global scope, and scope in block are used just inside a block.

```go
package main

func main() {
    {
        age := 19
        // this is okay
        fmt.Println(age)
    }

    // this is not okay
    // the age variable is out of scope
    fmt.Println(age)
}
```
A block it's defined by curly braces, curly braces are defined by:

- Functions
- Loops
- If statements
- Switch statements
- Select statements
- Explicit blocks
