1. [[install_vmware_onlinux]]
2.  Choose [tails](https://tails.net/install/download/) or [whonix](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VMware) to use as OS system
	What choose?
	**Tails** is used in a usb and when turn off all the cache inside of it disappear, it operates only in the ram so you will need a usb to use it. To download you could check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gO9fTnMxwYw
	**whonix** is also a minimal distribution on linux which don't have any extra port, it's only used to use tor, just like tails, and it can be only installed in virtual box, i will use this option because i don't have any extra usb
