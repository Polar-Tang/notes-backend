Stream cypher is also called stream state because this is basically goes encripting each single byte in order, generally by a [[xor]] computation. 
So here's an example of how you should  [[iterate over the channel]]
#### State cipher
A state in stream cypher means the current progress. 
Here's an example of a xor, wheere every start is the process on each bit:
```
plaintext = "010011"
key       = "101001"

state     = index 0
result    = "1"

state     = index 1
result    = "11"

state     = index 2
result    = "111"

state     = index 3
result    = "1110"

state     = index 4
result    = "11101"

state     = index 5
result    = "111010"
```

In the example of [[iterate over the channel]] we could access to whe same state of the key while iterating over the text channel
