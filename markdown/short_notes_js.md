# TS Data Structure
TypeScript supports a wide variety of data structures, many of which are inherited from JavaScript, but with the added benefit of TypeScript's static typing. Below is a list of the primary data structures supported by TypeScript:
TypeScript supports a wide variety of data structures, many of which are inherited from JavaScript, but with the added benefit of TypeScript's static typing. Below is a list of the primary data structures supported by TypeScript:
## Ts Data types
### **1. Primitives**

These are the basic data types in TypeScript:

- **`number`**: For both integers and floating-point numbers.
  ```typescript
  let num: number = 42;
  ```
- **`string`**: Represents text data.
  ```typescript
  let str: string = "Hello, World!";
  ```
- **`boolean`**: For `true` or `false` values.
  ```typescript
  let isDone: boolean = false;
  ```
- **`bigint`**: Represents large integers.
  ```typescript
  let big: bigint = 100n;
  ```
- **`symbol`**: A unique value, often used as keys in objects.
  ```typescript
  let sym: symbol = Symbol("unique");
  ```
- **`null`** and **`undefined`**: Represent the absence of a value.
  ```typescript
  let nothing: null = null;
  let notDefined: undefined = undefined;
  ```
- `HTMLElement` 

### **2. Arrays**

An array is a collection of elements of a specific type. There are two ways to declare an array:

- **Simple array**:
  ```typescript
  let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
  ```
- **Generic array**:
  ```typescript
  let fruits: Array<string> = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
  ```

### **3. Tuples**

Tuples are fixed-length arrays where each element has a specific type. They can also have optional or rest elements.

- **Basic tuple**:
  ```typescript
  let tuple: [string, number] = ["age", 25];
  ```
- **Tuple with optional element**:
  ```typescript
  let optionalTuple: [string, number?] = ["age"];
  ```

### **4. Objects**

Objects in TypeScript are used to represent key-value pairs, and you can define the structure of an object using **interfaces** or **type aliases**.

- **Object literal**:
  ```typescript
  let person: { name: string; age: number } = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
  };
  ```

- **Using an interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
  }
  let alice: Person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
  ```
- `non-null assertion operator`
**non-null assertion operator (`!`)** to tell TypeScript that these variables are **never `null`**
```ts
let frontButton: HTMLElement | null = document.getElementById("front");

frontButton!.addEventListener("click", () => { currentIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % imgArray.length; loadImage(); });
```
### **5. Maps**

A `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs, where keys and values can be of any type.

- **Map example**:
  ```typescript
  let map = new Map<string, number>();
  map.set("one", 1);
  map.set("two", 2);
  ```

### **6. Sets**

A `Set` is a collection of unique values. Each value may occur only once.

- **Set example**:
  ```typescript
  let set = new Set<number>();
  set.add(1);
  set.add(2);
  set.add(2); // Duplicate, won't be added again.
  ```

### **7. `Record` Utility Type**

`Record<K, T>` is a TypeScript utility type that creates an object type with keys of type `K` and values of type `T`.

- **Record example**:
  ```typescript
  let userScores: Record<string, number> = {
    Alice: 95,
    Bob: 85,
  };
  ```

### **8. Enums**

Enums allow you to define a set of named constants, which can be either **numeric** or **string** enums.

- **Numeric Enum**:
  ```typescript
  enum Direction {
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right,
  }
  let dir: Direction = Direction.Up;
  ```

- **String Enum**:
  ```typescript
  enum Color {
    Red = "RED",
    Green = "GREEN",
    Blue = "BLUE",
  }
  ```

### **9. `WeakMap` and `WeakSet`**

- **WeakMap**: Similar to `Map`, but the keys must be objects, and they are weakly referenced, meaning they can be garbage-collected if there are no other references to them.
  ```typescript
  let weakMap = new WeakMap<object, string>();
  let obj = {};
  weakMap.set(obj, "value");
  ```

- **WeakSet**: Similar to `Set`, but it can only hold objects, and they are weakly referenced.
  ```typescript
  let weakSet = new WeakSet<object>();
  let obj2 = {};
  weakSet.add(obj2);
  ```

### **10. Functions**

Functions are also treated as first-class objects in TypeScript, meaning they can be passed around as values. You can specify parameter types and return types:

- **Function declaration**:
  ```typescript
  function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  }
  ```

- **Arrow function**:
  ```typescript
  const multiply = (x: number, y: number): number => x * y;
  ```

### **11. Union and Intersection Types**

- **Union types**: A variable can hold one of several types.
  ```typescript
  let value: string | number;
  value = "hello";
  value = 123;
  ```

- **Intersection types**: Combine multiple types into one.
  ```typescript
  type A = { a: string };
  type B = { b: number };
  let ab: A & B = { a: "hello", b: 123 };
  ```

### **12. `any` and `unknown`**

- **`any`**: A type that disables type-checking, allowing any type of value.
  ```typescript
  let anything: any = "hello";
  anything = 123;
  ```

- **`unknown`**: Similar to `any`, but safer because you must perform type checks before using it.
  ```typescript
  let something: unknown = "hello";
  if (typeof something === "string") {
    console.log(something.toUpperCase());
  }
  ```

### **13. `void`, `null`, and `undefined`**

- **`void`**: Typically used for functions that do not return anything.
  ```typescript
  function logMessage(): void {
    console.log("This function doesn't return anything");
  }
  ```

- **`null`**: Represents an explicitly absent value.
  ```typescript
  let empty: null = null;
  ```

- **`undefined`**: Represents a value that hasn't been assigned.
  ```typescript
  let uninitialized: undefined = undefined;
  ```

### **14. `never`**

- **`never`** is a type that represents values that never occur, such as a function that never returns.
  ```typescript
  function throwError(message: string): never {
    throw new Error(message);
  }
  ```

### **15. Generics**

Generics allow creating data structures that can work with different types.

- **Generic Array**:
  ```typescript
  function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
  }
  ```

### **16. Classes and Interfaces**

Classes are used to define data structures and behavior together.

- **Class**:
  ```typescript
  class Person {
    name: string;
    constructor(name: string) {
      this.name = name;
    }
  }
  ```

- **Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface Car {
    make: string;
    model: string;
  }
  ```

### **Summary**:

TypeScript supports a wide variety of data structures, including primitives, objects, arrays, tuples, enums, sets, maps, and more. It also allows for advanced type manipulation with features like unions, intersections, generics, and utility types (`Record`, `Partial`, etc.). This flexibility allows TypeScript to model many different programming paradigms and handle complex data structures with strong typing.

## Js data types
All primitive types, except [`null`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/null) and [`undefined`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined), have their corresponding object wrapper types
![[Pasted image 20240916211933.png]]
### **Undefined**
Conceptually, `undefined` indicates the absence of a _value_, while `null` indicates the absence of an _object_. Generally something return undefined when it's devoid from a value. So
- A return statement with no value returns undefined, this mean every function with no return returns an undefined
```js
const somethinggg = () => {
console.log("hola") // hola
}

console.log(somethinggg()) // undefined

```
- A variable hasn’t been initialized
```js
let x;  // undefined
```
- Many methods return undefined when no element is found
### Null
Represents the intentional absence of any value. It's **explicitly assigned** to indicate "no value." **`null` is used in the prototype chain** to represent the absence of a prototype. So technically is the absence of an object

### Differences between null and undefined
 - Initializing
 ```
 let a;
console.log(a);  // Output: undefined (a is declared but not assigned a value)

let b = null;
console.log(b);  // Output: null (b is explicitly set to null)
 ```
- `null` is a **reserved word** in JavaScript, so it can't be redefined. It's always a **constant value** and can’t be changed or reassigned.
- **`undefined` is a global property**:
    
    - **`undefined`** is technically a global property that **can be redefined** (although this is strongly discouraged). It's a special identifier with the value of `undefined`, but because it's a property of the global object, it could be shadowed or changed accidentally (again, not recommended).
- In the prototype chain, **`null`** is important because it represents the **end** of the prototype chain. When you create objects using `Object.create()`, you can pass `null` to create an object with no prototype at all.
```js
console.log(typeof null);       // Output: "object" (this is a long-standing bug in JS)
console.log(typeof undefined);  // Output: "undefined"
```
```js
console.log(typeof null);       // Output: "object" (this is a long-standing bug in JS)
console.log(typeof undefined);  // Output: "undefined"

```
```js
const obj = Object.create(null);  // Creates an object with no prototype
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj));  // Output: null
```
### Bolean
Logical entity by two values
### numbr
The [`Number`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) type is a [double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number#number_encoding). Zero is the only number with two values, positive and negative, you could divide for zero and notice that:
```js
console.log(42 / +0); // Infinity
console.log(42 / -0); // -Infinity
```
### Bigint
Is similar to number, but is used for enormous numbers, A BigInt is not [strictly equal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality) to a Number with the same mathematical value, but it is [loosely](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality) so. A [`TypeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError) is thrown if BigInt values are mixed with regular numbers in arithmetic expressions
```js
 BigInt
const x = BigInt(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER); // 9007199254740991n
x + 1n === x + 2n; // false because 9007199254740992n and 9007199254740993n are unequal
```
### String
Represents textual data like a sequence of 16-bit unsigned integer values representing [UTF-16 code units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#utf-16_characters_unicode_code_points_and_grapheme_clusters).
### Value and reference
Great question! Understanding the difference between **value assignment** and **reference assignment** is key when working with JavaScript (or any language).

#### 1. **Assigning by Value**

When a variable is **assigned by value**, it means that the actual data (the value) is copied into the new variable. So, both variables hold separate copies of the data. Changes to one variable **do not affect** the other.

In JavaScript, **primitive types** (e.g., numbers, strings, booleans, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, `bigint`) are assigned by value.

#### Example of Value Assignment:
```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = x;  // y gets a *copy* of x's value

y = 20;

console.log(x);  // Output: 10 (x is unchanged)
console.log(y);  // Output: 20 (y is now 20)
```

In this case:
- `x` holds the value `10`.
- `y` gets a copy of `x`’s value, so when we change `y`, it does **not affect** `x`.



### Array copies
#### **Shallow copie**
```js
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const obj2 = { ...obj1 };  // Shallow copy

obj2.b.c = 3;  // Changes obj1.b.c as well

console.log(obj1.b.c);  // Output: 3
```
#### **Deep copies**
```
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const obj2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj1));  // Deep copy

obj2.b.c = 3;  // Does not affect obj1

console.log(obj1.b.c);  // Output: 2
```
###  **Assigning by Reference**

When a variable is **assigned by reference**, the new variable doesn’t get a copy of the data. Instead, both variables point to the **same object in memory**. If you change the data in one variable, the other will reflect those changes, because they reference the **same memory location**.

In JavaScript, **objects** (e.g., arrays, functions, objects) are assigned by reference.

#### Example of Reference Assignment:
```javascript
let obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
let obj2 = obj1;  // obj2 points to the same object as obj1

obj2.name = "Bob";

console.log(obj1.name);  // Output: "Bob" (both obj1 and obj2 reference the same object)
console.log(obj2.name);  // Output: "Bob"
```

In this case:
- `obj1` and `obj2` reference the **same object**.
- Changing `obj2.name` also changes `obj1.name`, because they both refer to the same object in memory.

#### **Key Differences Between Value and Reference Assignment**

| Aspect               | **Assigned by Value**                                 | **Assigned by Reference**                        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Types**       | Primitives (numbers, strings, booleans, `null`, etc.) | Objects (arrays, objects, functions)            |
| **Memory**           | Stores a **copy** of the value                        | Stores a **reference** (memory address)         |
| **Effect of Changes**| Changes to one variable **do not affect** the other   | Changes to one variable **affect** the other    |
| **Example**          | `let a = 5; let b = a;`                               | `let obj1 = { }; let obj2 = obj1;`              |

### **Implicit coercions**

Unlike Typescript, Javascript has a implicit coercions, whici means two different values in pressence of an operator could change its value.
**for example: `+ operator`**
```
const foo = 42; // foo is a number
const result = foo + "1"; // JavaScript coerces foo to a string, so it can be concatenated with the other operand
console.log(result); // 421
```

- - -
# Interface
In TypeScript, an `interface` is used to define the **shape** or structure of an object. It specifies the **types** of the properties an object should have
- - -
# Classes
the **structure** and **behavior** of an object.
```Ts
class UserAccount {
  name: string;
  id: number;
 
  constructor(name: string, id: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.id = id;
  }
}
```
**Creating an Instance of the Class**:
```Ts
const user: User = new UserAccount("Murphy", 1);
```
#### **new**
invoke the constructor function
# Functions
**def**
	set of statemens that perform a task or calculate a value that comes fron an input and give you an output. To use a function you need to call somewhere from the scope you wish to call
### parameters
A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. If the function chhange de paramte's properties these change globally
```ts
function myFunc(theArr) {
  theArr[0] = 30;
}

const arr = [45];

console.log(arr[0]); // 45
myFunc(arr);
console.log(arr[0]); // 30

```

### Also functions can be defined as a [function expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function)
```ts
const square = function (number) {
  return number * number;
};

console.log(square(4)); // 16

```
These have their own this context

### Arrow function
```ts
const getRectArea2 = (width: number, height: number) => width * height;
```

### Callback fn
A **callback function** is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked by the outer function to perform a task.
### IIFE
An **IIFE** is a function that **invokes itself automatically** right after its definition
**syntax:**
```
(function () {
  // Code here runs immediately
})();
```
- The parentheses around the function declaration `(function() {...})` tell JavaScript to treat it as an expression.
- The `()` at the end invokes the function **immediately**.
### Recursion
The act of a function calling itserlf, ir recives two inputs, a base case (end o recursion) and recursive case (resumes recursion)
- **Base case**: A condition that stops the recursion.
- **Recursive case**: The function calls itself with modified arguments to eventually reach the base case.
**Example:**
```js
const factorial = (n) => {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) return 1;  // Base case
  return n * factorial(n - 1);       // Recursive call
}

console.log(factorial(5));  // Output: 120

```
Have you ever seen self-similarity fractals? or something that repeates over itself  recursively? that's what happened here.
![[Pasted image 20240920094835.png]]
so here's the function got one parameter, and evaluates first if this parameters is 0 or equal to 1. then the recursive call will execute if the `if` it's not satisfied, this return a value which is n multiplied by its predecessor. The function doesn't stop after the first call because the result of the recursive call `factorial(n - 1)` value hasn't be computed yet, so the stack call waits there for the predecesor and continues subtracting 1, that is the subproblem.
1. **Call `factorial(5)`**:
    
    - `n = 5`.
    - The function checks `if (n === 0 || n === 1)`, which is **false**.
    - The function returns `5 * factorial(4)`. The calculation of `5 * factorial(4)` is **pushed onto the call stack**.
2. **Call `factorial(4)`**:
    
    - `n = 4`.
    - The function checks `if (n === 0 || n === 1)`, which is **false**.
    - The function returns `4 * factorial(3)`. This result is **pushed onto the call stack**.
3. **Call `factorial(3)`**:
    
    - `n = 3`.
    - The function checks `if (n === 0 || n === 1)`, which is **false**.
    - The function returns `3 * factorial(2)`. This result is **pushed onto the call stack**.
4. **Call `factorial(2)`**:
    
    - `n = 2`.
    - The function checks `if (n === 0 || n === 1)`, which is **false**.
    - The function returns `2 * factorial(1)`. This result is **pushed onto the call stack**.
5. **Call `factorial(1)`**:
    
    - `n = 1`.
    - The function checks `if (n === 0 || n === 1)`, which is **true**.
    - The function returns `1`. This **base case return value** is **pushed back to the previous call**.
the **base case** is reached (`n === 1`), and then the function **starts returning** values, going back up the call stack.
### **What do `try` and `catch` do?**

>In JavaScript, **`try` and `catch`** are used for **error handling**. They allow you to "catch" and respond to errors or exceptions that might occur in your code, instead of the entire script breaking or the application crashing. 

1. **`try`**: The code inside the `try` block is executed first. If it runs without issues, the `catch` block is **skipped**.
2. **`catch`**: If an error occurs inside the `try` block, the execution jumps immediately to the `catch` block. You can handle the error here, display a message, log it, or take any corrective action.
3. **`finally`** (optional): The code inside the `finally` block runs regardless of whether an error occurred or not. It's useful for cleanup actions (e.g., closing resources).

#### **Basic Syntax**:
```javascript
try {
  // Code that may throw an error
  let result = riskyOperation();
  console.log(result);
} catch (error) {
  // Code to handle the error
  console.error("An error occurred:", error);
} finally {
  // Optional cleanup code that runs whether there was an error or not
  console.log("This always runs.");
}
```

# JavaScript
## Symbol
newer data type primitive which is inmutable and isn't repeateble
**Well-known symbols**
they are built-in functions to customize the symbol behaviour
- **`Symbol.iterator`**: Defines the default iterator for an object.
- **`Symbol.toStringTag`**: Allows you to customize the default string description of an object.
- **`Symbol.hasInstance`**: Customizes how `instanceof` behaves for objects.

## Logic Operators
the increment&decrement operator can only be applied to a **variable** or a **property** that can actually store values.
# Array methods
#### **findIndex()**
The method findIndex() returned the first item index that satisface the provided prove, otherwise this method return -1
#### **filter()**
create a shallow copy of the elements that pass the test. The correct syntax for `.filter()` requires a **callback function** that will be executed for each element of the array that returns true or false
```js
const words = ['spray', 'elite', 'exuberant', 'destruction', 'present'];

const result = words.filter((word) => word.length > 6);

console.log(result);
// Expected output: Array ["exuberant", "destruction", "present"]
```
# String methods
#### **match()**
Returns all of the ocurrencese of the provided regex from an array
```js
const paragraph = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. It barked.';
const regex = /[A-Z]/g;
const found = paragraph.match(regex);

console.log(found);
// Expected output: Array ["T", "I"]
```
#### **includes()**
return tru or false if the string could be found in the provided array
```js
const sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.';

const word = 'fox';

console.log(
  `The word "${word}" ${
    sentence.includes(word) ? 'is' : 'is not'
  } in the sentence`,
);
// Expected output: "The word "fox" is in the sentence"

```
