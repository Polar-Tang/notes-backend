`XML`, or "Extensible Markup Language" is a text-based format for representing structured information, like JSON - but different (and a bit more verbose).
It's similar to the HTML but the tags aren't defined previously:
```xml
<root>
  <id>1</id>
  <genre>Action</genre>
  <title>Iron Man</title>
  <director>Jon Favreau</director>
</root>
```
The same data in json:
```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "genre": "Action",
  "title": "Iron Man",
  "director": "Jon Favreau"
}
```
