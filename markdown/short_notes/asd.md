### Which OAuth flow should I use?

Choosing one flow over the rest depends on the application you are building:

- If you are developing a long-running application (e.g. web app running on the server) in which the user grants permission only once, and the client secret can be safely stored, then the [authorization code flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-flow) is the recommended choice.
    
- In scenarios where storing the client secret is not safe (e.g. desktop, mobile apps or JavaScript web apps running in the browser), you can use the [authorization code with PKCE](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-pkce-flow), as it provides protection against attacks where the authorization code may be intercepted.
    
- For some applications running on the backend, such as CLIs or daemons, the system authenticates and authorizes the app rather than a user. For these scenarios, [Client credentials](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/client-credentials-flow) is the typical choice. This flow does not include user authorization, so only endpoints that do not request user information (e.g. user profile data) can be accessed.
    
- The [implicit grant](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/implicit-flow) has some important downsides: it returns the token in the URL instead of a trusted channel, and does not support refresh token. Thus, we don't recommend using this flow.
    

The following table summarizes the flows' behaviors:

| FLOW                         | Access User Resources | Requires Secret Key (Server-Side) | Access Token Refresh |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Authorization code           | Yes                   | Yes                               | Yes                  |
| Authorization code with PKCE | Yes                   | No                                | Yes                  |
| Client credentials           | No                    | Yes                               | No                   |
| Implicit grant               | Yes                   | No                                | No                   |
|                              |                       |                                   |                      |

the disclaimer at the start of login the page: "You must be on the Spotify network / VPN for this to work" This means i shouldn't have access to or it means that the application will not work if it isn't in the network/vpn
