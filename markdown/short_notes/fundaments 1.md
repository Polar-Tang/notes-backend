# Fundaments
Fundaments are concepted shared between all the langueges, things that all the language have in common, here you can find fundamental concepts which could be find in many languages.
**little advice**
some of the link reference may contein anoying adds, i'd prefer to disable javascript on the browser or to use an add blocker

## Assign by a value
When a variable is **assigned by value**, it means that the actual data (the value) is copied into the new variable. So, **copies the value itself** when assigning one variable to another.
#### 

### 2. **Assigning by Reference**

When a variable is **assigned by reference**, the new variable doesn’t get a copy of the data. Instead, both variables point to the **same object in memory**. If you change the data in one variable, the other will reflect those changes, because they reference the **same memory location**.

In JavaScript, **objects** (e.g., arrays, functions, objects) are assigned by reference.

|Aspect|**Assigned by Value**|**Assigned by Reference**|
|---|---|---|
|**Data Types**|Primitives (numbers, strings, booleans, `null`, etc.)|Objects (arrays, objects, functions)|
|**Memory**|Stores a **copy** of the value|Stores a **reference** (memory address)|
|**Effect of Changes**|Changes to one variable **do not affect** the other|Changes to one variable **affect** the other|

## Format
**The format operator % is used for string formatting**. It lets you construct strings by embedding variables enclosed in a format specifier like %s for strings, %d for integers, and so on.

**Examples:**
 - [formating string on python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-string-format-method/)
 - [printf on bash](https://linuxize.com/post/bash-printf-command/)

## Recursion

**Examples:**
- [MDN about recursion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Recursion)

## Callstack
Callstack is a mechanism on the language interpreter engine which will be running, from the top to the down and left to side, the script and remember them until resolve them

**Examples:**
- [Call stack in JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack)
# API
It's any **interface** or set of tools/functions that a developer interacts with.
