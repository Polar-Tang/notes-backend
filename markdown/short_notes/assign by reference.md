When a variable is **assigned by reference**, the new variable doesn’t get a copy of the data. Instead, both variables point to the **same object in memory**. If you change the data in one variable, the other will reflect those changes, because they reference the **same memory location**.

In JavaScript, **objects** (e.g., arrays, functions, objects) are assigned by reference.

|Aspect|**Assigned by Value**|**Assigned by Reference**|
|---|---|---|
|**Data Types**|Primitives (numbers, strings, booleans, `null`, etc.)|Objects (arrays, objects, functions)|
|**Memory**|Stores a **copy** of the value|Stores a **reference** (memory address)|
|**Effect of Changes**|Changes to one variable **do not affect** the other|Changes to one variable **affect** the other|
