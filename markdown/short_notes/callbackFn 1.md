A callback function is a function passed as argument into another function

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous
When we call a callback function **synchronous** the function it's executed inmediatley the outer function it's called.
But when we call the function asynchronously are called later, after the asyncronous task has completed.
```js
let value = 1;

doSomething(() => {
  value = 2;
});

console.log(value);
```
If do something would be sinchronous value will be 2, if it's not, value would be 1.
Examples of synchronous callbacks include the callbacks passed to [`Array.prototype.map()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map), [`Array.prototype.forEach()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach), etc. Examples of asynchronous callbacks include the callbacks passed to [`setTimeout()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setTimeout "setTimeout()") and [`Promise.prototype.then()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then).

### Syntax
```js
(args) => callbackFn(args)
```
