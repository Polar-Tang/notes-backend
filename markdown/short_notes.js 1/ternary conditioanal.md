This conditional it's like a short circuit which is often used to replace [[if...else]]. 
In the ternary you have a condition followed by a question mark, there goes the statement if the condition is [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy), then, the condition after the the colon is the statement for the Â [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy)
I like to read like this: 
```
If this ? it's true do this : if it's false do that
```
