DOM tree refers to the structur of a HTML document, which start in in a root node, like the html tag, and go branching out into different nodes, smaller than the last one, and so on.
For **example**
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      <p>Hello, World!</p>
      <p>Welcome to the DOM tree.</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
You got this HTML and its representation would look like this:
```
html
├── head
│   └── title
└── body
    └── div
        ├── p
        └── p
```
