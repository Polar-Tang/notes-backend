Type assertion could use angle brackes or the keyword `as` to tell more about the type of any variable to typescript
```ts
let someValue: any = "this is a string";
let strLength: number = (<string>someValue).length; // Type assertion using angle brackets
```

```ts
let someValue: any = "this is a string";
let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length; // Type assertion using 'as'
```

`number[]` can be also written as `Array<number>`
