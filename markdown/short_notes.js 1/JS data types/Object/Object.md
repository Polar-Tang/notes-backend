The object are a JavaScript data type, which is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. These collections of keys are inherited from Object.prototype, i mean they [inheritance this properties from the chain prototype]([[prototype-based inheritance]]). 

### Inheritance in the chain (risk operation)
The particularity in this heritance is that any object in the prototype will change if we modify their prototype chain. 
We could craft a method and this will be accessible from every object.
```js
// Adding a method to Object.prototype
Object.prototype.greet = function() {
    return `Hello from Object.prototype!`;
};

const obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
const obj2 = { name: "Bob" };

console.log(obj1.greet()); // Output: "Hello from Object.prototype!"
console.log(obj2.greet()); // Output: "Hello from Object.prototype!"
console.log({}.greet());   // Output: "Hello from Object.prototype!"
```
Here the method `greet` is available for all the objects, but as this method is available to all objects globally we could mess up and redefine an existing method or overload the prototype by fulling of methods. So you might want to use a construct or the [[create]] methods instead
