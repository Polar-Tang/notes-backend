Represents the intentional absence of any value. It's **explicitly assigned** to indicate "no value." **`null` is used in the prototype chain** to represent the absence of a prototype. So technically is the absence of an object

### Differences between null and undefined
 - Initializing
 ```js
 let a;
console.log(a);  // Output: undefined (a is declared but not assigned a value)

let b = null;
console.log(b);  // Output: null (b is explicitly set to null)
 ```
- `null` is a **reserved word** in JavaScript, so it can't be redefined. It's always a **constant value** and canâ€™t be changed or reassigned.
- **`undefined` is a global property**:
    
    - **`undefined`** is technically a global property that **can be redefined** (although this is strongly discouraged). It's a special identifier with the value of `undefined`, but because it's a property of the global object, it could be shadowed or changed accidentally (again, not recommended).
- In the prototype chain, **`null`** is important because it represents the **end** of the prototype chain. When you create objects using `Object.create()`, you can pass `null` to create an object with no prototype at all.
```js
console.log(typeof null);       // Output: "object" (this is a long-standing bug in JS)
console.log(typeof undefined);  // Output: "undefined"
```
```js
console.log(typeof null);       // Output: "object" (this is a long-standing bug in JS)
console.log(typeof undefined);  // Output: "undefined"

```
```js
const obj = Object.create(null);  // Creates an object with no prototype
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj));  // Output: null
```
