It's literally an array method that iterates over a given array, This goes using a **Callback Function** for each element in the array, and this applies at least once. The return of each **Callback Function** is used by the method.

### Syntax
All iterative methods have the same syntax:
```js
method(callbackFn, thisArg)
```

Where `callbackFn` takes three arguments:

[`element`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#element)

The current element being processed in the array.

[`index`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#index)

The index of the current element being processed in the array.

[`array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#array)

The array that the method was called upon.

### Return value
What `callbackFn` is expected to return depends on the array method that was called.
