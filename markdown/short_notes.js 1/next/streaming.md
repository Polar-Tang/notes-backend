Streaming it's a technique from next, that allows you to split the code into chunks and progressively stream them from the server to the client as they become ready. This works nice with React, where each component is considered a chunk.
To use streamig we use suspense from react.
Wrap the content with the suspense, en then the fallback:
```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<RevenueChartSkeleton />}>
	<RevenueChart />
</Suspense>
```
The the component should be doing the fetching:
```tsx
import { fetchRevenue } from '@/app/lib/data';

export default async function RevenueChart() {
	const revenue = await fetchRevenue();
}
```
