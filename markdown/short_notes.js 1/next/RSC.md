React Server Components it's a compact binary that is utilized for next to render the components in the server side. 
- Server Components support JavaScript Promises, providing a solution for asynchronous tasks like data fetching natively. You can use `async/await` syntax without needing `useEffect`, `useState` or other data fetching libraries.
- Server Components run on the server, so you can keep expensive data fetches and logic on the server, only sending the result to the client.
- Since Server Components run on the server, you can query the database directly without an additional API layer. This saves you from writing and maintaining additional code. (monolitic)

The service side rendering allows your application to display real-time or frequently updated data. This is ideal for applications where data changes often.
Example of a react server side renderind:
```jsx
// Server Component
export default function Page() {
  // Action
  async function create(formData: FormData) {
    'use server';
 
    // Logic to mutate data...
  }
 
  // Invoke the action using the "action" attribute
  return <form action={create}>...</form>;
}
```
