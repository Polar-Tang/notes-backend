### Toggle actions
So `togleActions` are 4 keywords:
- play
- pause
- resume
- reverse
- restart
- reset
- complete
- none

As i mention the toggle actions must have at least 4 keywords. 
The first one it's when the point it's in the viewport
The second one is when the scroll moves forwards of the point
The this is when the viewport comes back to the point
The fourth one is when the viewport fully leaves from the top
