Some function may be expecting to utilize an number as as argunment, so in JavaScript the values are forcibly turned into another data types, example where a value is forced as a number:
- `Array.split()`
```js
const array = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"];

array.splice("3", "2");
// internally: array.splice(Number("3"), Number("2"));

elementToDelete(array, element);
console.log(array);
```

This coercion truncate the number, and If the number is `NaN` or `-0`, it's returned as `0`.
The result it's always a number, or infinity.
