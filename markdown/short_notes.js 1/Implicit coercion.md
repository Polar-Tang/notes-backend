### **Implicit coercions**

Unlike Typescript, Javascript has a implicit coercions, which means two different values in pressence of an operator could change its value.
**for example: `+ operator`**
```js
const foo = 42; // foo is a number
const result = foo + "1"; // JavaScript coerces foo to a string, so it can be concatenated with the other operand
console.log(result); // 421
```
