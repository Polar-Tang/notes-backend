### What is useState?
`setState()` schedules an update to a component’s `state` object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.

#### Syntax:
```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
```

- `State`
- `setState`
- `initial state`
- `CalbackFn (optional)`
#### Return value
The [useState](vscode-file://vscode-app/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) return an array, that's why the state and setState is seted between brackes `[]`, you could change it to an object if you are using **for example** a custom hook:
```jsx
const {formState, handleChange} = useForm({
	name: '',
	email: '',
	password: ''
})
```

### CalbackFN
At the same time i could pass it a `Callback`, and the return value of the callbaqck will be utilized as the new state. Where the value of the callbkack is called `prevState` because is the previous state of the component 

```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState({
	hour: time.now
})

setState((prevState) => {
	return {...prevState, today: true}
})
```
The argument of the callback always work as the previous state
