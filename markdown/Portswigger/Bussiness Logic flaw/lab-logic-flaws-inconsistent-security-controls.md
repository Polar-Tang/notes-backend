We start from a basic directory fuzzing
```sh
wfuzz -u https://LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -t 100

So, it detects admin file, when we go there says our email must be `@dontwannacry` domain, so taking that on notes, if the registration process has certain restrictions, check whether updating the same data after registration bypasses those restrictions. Manipulating parameters in update functions is often an overlooked approach.
