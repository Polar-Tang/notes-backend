I send the request triggered with insufficient funds with the cart empty and the error says i do not have enough money, so the problem seems to be the application isn't validating what is in the cart.
![[Pasted image 20241106121010.png]]There are two different endpoints when we buy something: `/cart?err=INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` when we can achive the product for lack of money and `/cart/order-confirmation?order-confirmed=true` when we bough the product, but the last endpoint is not validating whether we can buy the product, so add that coveted jacket on the cart and then send the request of a valid bought
