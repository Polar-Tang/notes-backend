Doing a quick scan for the target:
```sh
feroxbuster -u https://0a6b00b60453a11b81776b5800f400c0.web-security-academy.net/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt
```
We found the admin path and when we try to visit it, it says that our email must be `@dontwannacry`. So take a note on that.
In this lab the email accepts indefinitely characters for the email field, but there's a dissent, the string of mostly sql-based data base, have a limit of 255 characters, so we can cause a overflow in the field from the lab.
so intercept the registration page and use a string large enough to overflow and leaving `@dontwannacry` at the end 
Use
`@dontwannacry.<LAB-ID>.web-security-academy.net
