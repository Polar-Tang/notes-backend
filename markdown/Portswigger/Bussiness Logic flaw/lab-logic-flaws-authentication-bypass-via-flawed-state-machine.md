-------
First of all, on every Portswigger lab i use the same command:
```sh
feroxbuster -u https://0a34000804cad75d80c6cbd3005d00d5.web-security-academy.net/ -x php,js -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-directories.txt
```
At first glance if you see the normal workflow this lab doesn't seems to be vulnerable.

---------
The methodology for this to intercept the request and use the set cookie isolated, without following the workflow, in such disordered way some functions broken functions may reveal

-----------
Intercept the login page, send it in the repeater, then use the set session cookie to use it in the cookie header of `GET /admin`

After that you will see the admin pannel and the you could do `GET /admin/delete?username=carlos`.
