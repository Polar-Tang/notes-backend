Authentication means the process of verify who you are in an application, nowadays this process rely in a lot of technologies, and there are 3 differents types

- Something you **have**, This is a physical object such as a mobile phone or security token. These are sometimes called "possession factors".
- Something you **are** or do. For example, your biometrics or patterns of behavior. These are sometimes called "inherence factors".
Basically authentication is "what you are", which is different from authorization which likely means "what you do" and to do more than what you are allowed to do, it would be a [[Broken_authorization]] issue
Authentication vulnerabillities allow to gain access to sensitive data and functionallity
#### Knowledge factors
Something you **know**, such as a password or the answer to a security question. These are sometimes called "knowledge factors". This are related in **password-based vulnerabilities** 

##### Password-bassed Vulnerabilities
Sometimes to verify as a user you need to provide a string which only you do know, so if an attacker has you password is sufficient proof of the user's identity. So there different ways to obtain the user's password, the most obvious way of accessing to an account is by "guessing" it through a brute force attack, as an attacker you could brute-force different fields besides the password, for example, the email, which use to have the following pattern: `firstname.lastname@somecompany.com` also high-privileged user has a predictable name, such as `admin` or `administrator` check whether the website discloses potential usernames publicly, in post, in verbose errors.
But usually many attempts will be blocked somehow
- Locking the account that the remote user is trying to access if they make too many failed login attempts
- Blocking the remote user's IP address if they make too many login attempts in quick succession
#### Examples
When the password or the name is right normally it shows as a different status code from the incorrect ones, this way is possible to enumerate valid usernames, [[lab-password-reset-broken-logic]], [[lab-username-enumeration-via-different-responses]], [[lab-username-enumeration-via-subtly-different-responses]]. 
It's worth to identify after how many attempts an IP is blocked, and how is reset, maybe after login it can reset, like [[lab-broken-bruteforce-protection-ip-block]]. Other times it will lock a correct account after many atempts: [[lab-username-enumeration-via-account-lock]].
#### Prevent
A way to preveting is by using rate limit in a application, after many request is a shot period of time you account is locked. 
Typically, the IP can only be unblocked in one of the following ways:

- Automatically after a certain period of time has elapsed
- Manually by an administrator
- Manually by the user after successfully completing a CAPTCHA
