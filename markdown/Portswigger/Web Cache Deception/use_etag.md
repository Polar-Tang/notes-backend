To use the `ETag` header for checking if a resource was modified, you can leverage the `If-None-Match` header in a follow-up request. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Retrieve the Initial `ETag`**: 
   - When you first request the resource, you receive an `ETag` value in the response header. In this case:
     ```http
     ETag: "4071dacd5afdb1:0"
     ```
   
2. **Use `If-None-Match` in a Subsequent Request**:
   - On your next request to the same resource, include the `If-None-Match` header and set it to the previously retrieved `ETag` value. For example:
     ```http
     GET /path/to/resource HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com
     If-None-Match: "4071dacd5afdb1:0"
     ```
   
3. **Interpret the Response**:
   - If the resource **has not been modified** since you last retrieved it, the server responds with a `304 Not Modified` status code. This indicates that the cached version is still current, and there is no need to download the full resource again.
   - If the resource **has been modified**, the server responds with a `200 OK` status code along with the new version of the resource and a potentially new `ETag` value.

### Example Scenario

**Initial Request**:
```http
GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

**Server Response**:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: image/x-icon
Last-Modified: Wed, 25 Sep 2024 14:54:21 GMT
Accept-Ranges: bytes
ETag: "4071dacd5afdb1:0"
Date: Thu, 14 Nov 2024 18:48:11 GMT
Content-Length: 1406
```

**Follow-up Request Using `If-None-Match`**:
```http
GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
If-None-Match: "4071dacd5afdb1:0"
```

**Possible Server Responses**:
1. If the resource is unchanged:
   ```http
   HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
   ```
2. If the resource has changed:
   ```http
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: image/x-icon
   Last-Modified: [new timestamp]
   ETag: "new-etag-value"
   Content-Length: [new content length]
   ```

Using this approach with `If-None-Match` saves bandwidth and allows you to detect changes efficiently by comparing only the `ETag` value rather than re-downloading the full resource.
