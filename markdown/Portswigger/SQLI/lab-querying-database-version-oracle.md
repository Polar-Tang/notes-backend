`UNION SELECT` should be used with two or more selections, as we see in [[lab-determine-number-of-columns]]. 

So we need to use the selection, like just before.
`/filter?category='+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL--`
But this won't work.
As the web application is using ORACLE as RDBMS, we need to adjust the syntax slightly
```url
%27+UNION+SELECT+NULL,null+FROM+dual--
```
For further information explore the cheat sheet https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet
And after then we corroborate we should check the version using `v$version`, so just let's add it to the union select
```url
%27+UNION+SELECT+banner,null+FROM+v$version--
```
