Many websites use cdn to act like a revesre proxy. The CDN adds some unique headers that help the main server identify the request coming from the CDN.

Contet-length is the length of the body from the request, on the other hand, transfer encoding is used to specify that the request's body will be sent as a fragments of data

Now according to the RFC standard, when an HTTP request contains both the **CL** and **TE** headers, then the CL header should be ignored. But there are many servers that are not configured according to the RFC. So, by crafting a malicious request and figuring out the server processor of the header, an attacker can smuggle the HTTP request inside the HTTP request.

**Hidden Attack Scenario’s**

- **GET request with CL! = 0**

We know that GET requests don’t have a post body, but no such thing is laid out in the RFC standard. It only states that if you send post data along with GET request, then the servers might reject it. But if the server allows such a case due to misconfiguration, then it can be exploited in the wild.
