In cryptography, the probability of success is measured on a scale from 0 to 1, where:

0 means an event is impossible.

1 means an event is guaranteed.


Imagine a bag containing red and white balls. The probability of picking a white ball depends on the ratio of white balls to the total number of balls in the bag.

Now consider an n-bit cryptographic key:

For an n-bit key, there are  possible unique keys.

If we are trying to guess a specific key, there is exactly 1 successful key and  total keys.


Thus, the probability of successfully guessing the key in one attempt is:

P = \frac{\text{Number of Successful Keys}}{\text{Total Possible Keys}}

For a 256-bit cryptographic key:

P = \frac{1}{2^{256}}

Clarifications:

1. 256-bit Keys:
If you meant a 256-bit key (as in modern cryptographic systems like AES-256), then . The number of possibilities is astronomically large:



2^{256} \approx 1.157 \times 10^{77}

2. 8-bit Example:
If you meant an 8-bit key, then :



2^8 = 256

Final Formula:

For any n-bit cryptographic key, the probability of guessing it in a single attempt is:

P = \frac{1}{2^n}

This formula assumes that all keys are equally likely, which is typically true in well-designed cryptographicÂ systems.
