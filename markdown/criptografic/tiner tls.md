The TLS, is a protocol utilized by the https and is most the responsible of the encryption on this protocol, whenever we visit a httpps website we encrypt our data utilizing it **public key**. A tls fewer than the recomended bits could result in a key factoring attack.

- A **512-bit RSA key** provides only about **60 bits of security**.
- A **2048-bit RSA key**, on the other hand, provides about **112 bits of security**.
We could see the TLS by different ways:
- **CURL**
```sh
curl -vI https://<domain> 2>&1 | grep 'Server certificate'
```
- OpenSSL
```sh
openssl s_client -connect <domain>:443
```
