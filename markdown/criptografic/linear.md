Linear are bitwise operator like the XOR where the order of the vector did'n influence the results.
It's like `+` and `*`
- XOR is **commutative**: The order of operands doesn't matter.  
    `a ^ b == b ^ a`
- XOR is **associative**: You can group operations in any way.  
    `(a ^ b) ^ c == a ^ (b ^ c)`
- XOR is **linear** because it operates independently on each bit of its operands. Thereâ€™s no dependency between different bit positions.
