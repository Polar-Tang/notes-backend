Is the time and the cost to achive the bruteforce, there are parallelism, memory, precomputation, and the number of targets.

### Paralelism
- consider two attacks of 2^56 operations each
- One of the should be sequential because it execute task that demands so
- the other could be paralelized adn thanks the cores you could 2^16 = 65536 paralelized
- this reduce 2^56 / 2^16 = 240 operations.

### Memmory
The second factor to determine the cost of an atack is the memmory
- How many operation do we need to operate
- the size of the data accessed
- the access pattern
- How data is structure in memmory 
whereas reading from the CPU’s cache memory takes around 20 cycles (for the L3 cache), and reading from DRAM usually takes at least 100 cycles. A factor of 100 can make the difference between one day and three months.

### Precomputation
Are computation that should be calculated only once. For example consider the trade time off attack [which includes an collect of data to reduce the complexity or the attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time/memory/data_tradeoff_attack#:~:text=A%20time/memory/data%20tradeoff,not%20designed%20to%20resist%20it.).

### Number of targets
The greater the number of targets, the greater the attack surface, and the more attackers can learn about the keys they’re after. For example if you target a single nbit key, it will take 2n attempts, but there's another key, let's say *m* which you are not interested in, so there are 2n / M atterps to succedd. For example, to break one 128-bit key of 216 = 65536 target keys, it will take on average 2128 − 16 = 2112 evaluations of the cipher.
