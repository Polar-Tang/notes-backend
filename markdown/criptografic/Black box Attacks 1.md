Here are the list, from the weakest to the strongest of cypher atackas in black box
- (Ciphertext-only attackers) Coa: have the cypher text but not the plaintext, or know how evene the cypher text were selected
- Known-plaintext attackers (KPA): observe ciphertexts and do know the associated plaintexts.
- Chosen-plaintext attackers (CPA): can perform encryption queries for plaintexts of their choice and observe the resulting ciphertexts
- Chosen-ciphertext attackers (CCA): can both encrypt and decrypt; that is, they get to perform encryption queries and decryptionÂ queries.
