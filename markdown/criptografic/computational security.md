Computational security implies the possibilities in practise, how long will take as to break the cypher text with a reduced quantity of time, reasonable resources such as memory, hardware, budget, energy, and so on.
**For example** consider the following cipher **E** for when you know the pair cypher text **(P, C)** but not the 128-bit key **K**, as served to compute: C = E(K, P). After 2^128 we would find some one that satisfy E(K, P) = C, Easy right? but in practice, even tryinf 100 billion of computation per second it will takes us 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 years.
Computationally speaking there are two important terms
- *t* which is the limit of computations that the attacker is limited to do
- *E* Called epsiolon, which is a limit on the probabillity of success

that an attacker performing *t* attacks is a higher number than the probabillities to success *e*
When we say that a cryptographic scheme is (t, ε)-secure, we refer to a estimative, no attacker who perfomr less than *t* operations will succedd, but neither by apply more than *t* operations will succedd, t is a lower bound on the computation effort needed. 

For example, consider a symmetric cipher with a 128-bit key. Ideally, this cipher should be (t, t/2128)-secure for any value of t between 1 and 2128. Any better attack would have to exploit some imperfection in the cypher
in a classical bruteforce attack an attacker tries all the 2^123 keys and success, but also might tries only t = 264 keys, and succeeds with a probability of ε = 264/2128 = 2−64. When an attacker only tries a fraction of all keys, the success probability is proportional to the number of keys tried.
A cipher with a key of *n* bits is at best (t, t/2^n)-secure

### Mesuring security level in bits
If we know the number of operations it needs to break a cypher, we just need to do a binary log to get the result in bits. For example if it takes 1000000 operations, the security level is log2(1000000), or about 20 bits.
