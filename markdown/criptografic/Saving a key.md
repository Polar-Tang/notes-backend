Once you have a secret key, you need to keep it secret, yet available when
you need it. There are three ways to address this problem.
Key wrapping (encrypting the key using a second key)
The problem with this approach is that the second key must be
available when you need to decrypt the protected key. In practice, this
second key is often generated from a password supplied by the user
when he needs to use the protected key. That’s how private keys for
the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol are usually protected.
On-the-fly generation from a password
Here, no encrypted file needs to be stored because the key comes
straight out from the password. Modern systems like miniLock use this
method. Although this method is more direct than key wrapping, it’s
less widespread, in part because it’s more vulnerable to weak
passwords. Say, for example, that an attacker captured some encrypted
message: if key wrapping was used, the attacker first needs to get the
protected key file, which is usually stored locally on the user’s file
system and therefore not easy to access. But if on-the-fly generation
was used, the attacker can directly search for the correct password by
attempting to decrypt the encrypted message with candidate
passwords. And if the password is weak, the key is compromised.
Storing the key on a hardware token (smart card or USB dongle)
In this approach, the key is stored in secure memory and remains safe
even if the computer is compromised. This is the safest approach to
key storage, but also the costliest and least convenient because it
requires you to carry the hardware token with you and run the risk of
losing it. Smart cards and USB dongles usually require you to enter a
password to unlock the key from the secure memory.
