When you try to bruteforce a basic [[stream cypher]] encryption, you probably try to do a **systematic brute-forcing** instead of using a simple wordlist. 

------
### Example
Imagine we want to try to brute force a sql password, and we know the password is not a simple, the person who owns it like to format its passwords. Let's calculate the number of the possible combinations first. SQL passwords may vary assuming the  **DRMBS**, but every sql password requires at least one uppercase letter, lowercase letter, digit, and special character.

-  ASCII: 94
-  UTF-16: 1,112,064
##### **Calculating Combinations**

To calculate the total number of possible combinations for a password:

###### **Formula**:

C = N^L

Where:

- *C*: Total combinations.
- *N*: Number of possible characters (character set size).
- *L*: Length of the password.
###### **Example Calculation**:

For a password of length **12**, with:
- **N = 94** (assuming the full ASCII printable character set): 
	*C* = 94^12 *≈* *4.7* × 10^23

For a UTF-16 password of length **12**:

- Unicode allows a much larger character set (up to ~1,112,064 characters in modern implementations): 
	*C* = 1,112,064^12 *≈* *3.4* ×10^72
Now with a oneliner of wfuzz we could try this posibillities
