Hashcat is a powerfult tool written in C to bruteforces hash.

### How it works
This takes takes a given hash
```
$2b$12$eImiTXuWVxfM37uY4JANj.Qom7BoqDQjFY4Rk8xE4/A6ZlCk5c5n2
```
Hashcat tries different combinations utilizing a specific algorithm, you can see all the modes with `hashcat --help`
```sh
hashcat -m 0 basicMD5.txt
```
So applies a inverse 

#### Example
We have 256 for each letter, because each letter is a single byte and this are 8 bits, all the posible values from each bit are 256. Now if we got a password of 8 letters, actaully ascii characters, this will be 256⁸ posibilities which hashcat will try to hash using different algorithm computations (e.g, MD5, SHA1, bycript) to decrypt it, and compare with another word from the list that has passed from the same encription.

```
3200 | bcrypt $2*$, Blowfish (Unix)                               | Operating System
```

that's the key, and when you say "complexity of `N^72`" that's number of possibillities that hashcat has to try? each byte elevated to 72
