Is a [[block cipher 1]] with a [[Feistel schemes 1]].
Basically is pretty similar to the basic feistel scheme

The traditional feistel scheme the **F** function takes different rounds keys, and in DES the F functions take a 48-bit round key, which is derived from the 56-bit key, K. Due to this tiny size In 1997 the DESCHALL Project was the first group to publicly break DES encryption, which was broken by a simpleÂ [brute force attack](https://blog.boot.dev/security/how-do-brute-force-attackers-know-they-found-the-key/). 
In DES the original key is usually break into 16 pices to make 16 rounds
