Asymmetric keys are different becuase they are not just a set of random bits, they instead represt an object, sucha as a large number with specific properties. There's a generic simmetric key algorithm where we send a pseudo randomn number as a seed. A naive example where we generate a encryption by generate two random primes about the same length, and also you would need another process to determine what of all of these number will be the prime.
```sh
openssl genrsa 4096
```
Notice that the key comes in a specific format—namely, base64-
encoded data between the BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY and END RSA PRIVATE KEY
markers. That’s a standard encoding format supported by most systems,
which then convert this representation to raw bytes of data. The dot
sequences at the beginning are a kind of progress bar, and e is 65537
(0x10001) indicates the parameter to use when encrypting (remember that
RSA encrypts by computing C = Pe mod n).
