Tipically the blocks from the [[block cipher 1]] goes encripting every round, and each round need their own key. These keys procedes from a master key, which is spliting in chunks for use it in the rounds.


In the real world, there are many different production algorithms for key schedules. At Passly, we've been asked to implement a simple key schedule that can be used in our test suite. It doesn't need to be "production-level-secure", it just needs to get the high-level idea across.

Complete the `deriveRoundKey()` function. It accepts a master key, which is `4` bytes long and represented as an array of bytes. It will also accept a "round number", which is just an `int` representing _which_ round key is being derived. The key schedule produces a round key where each byte in the round key is the original byte from the master key `XOR`ed with the binary representation of the round number.

For example:

```
masterKey     = 01101100 01110000...
roundNumber   = 00000001
roundKey      = 01101101 01110001...
```

or when `roundNumber = 5`

```
masterKey     = 01101100 01110000...
roundNumber   = 00000101
roundKey      = 01101001 01110101...
```
