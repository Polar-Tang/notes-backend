AES is a block cipher just like DES, but there are some key differences:

- AES uses 128, 192, or 256 bit keys. DES uses 56 bit keys
- AES block size is 128 bits, DES block size is 64 bits
- DES is insecure by modern standards, AES is still considered secure
- AES uses a subs-perm network, DES uses Feistel
