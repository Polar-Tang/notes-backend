Vigenere is a [[stream cypher]] which is similar to the Caesar Cypher. Instead of just shift the whole letters we utilize a key. so we Utilize a pattern to goes shifting the letters.
For example, if the key is DUH, letters in the plaintext are shifted using the values 3, 20, 7 because D is three letters after A, U is 20 letters after A, and H is seven letters after A. The 3, 20, 7 pattern repeats until you’ve encrypted the entire plaintext. For example, the word CRYPTO would encrypt to FLFSNV using DUH as the key: C is shifted three positions to F, R is shifted 20 positions to L, and so on. Figure 1-3 illustrates this principle when encrypting the sentence THEY DRINK THE TEA.
in a **cypher mode** we could do different permutations for the same letters, avoiding to reveal duplicates. If the plain text is N letters long we need need to utilize N permutations, if for each pattern we utilize the same permutation we could fall into a weakness for frequency analysis, we should do a different permutation for each letter such as otp
