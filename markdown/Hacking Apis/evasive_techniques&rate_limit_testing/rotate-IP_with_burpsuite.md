9. Copy and paste your access key and secret key into the relevant fields.
Click the Save Keys button. When you are ready to use IP Rotate, update
the target host field to your target API and click Enable. Note that you do
not need to enter in the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) in the target host
field. Instead, use the Target Protocol button to specify either HTTP
or HTTPS. A cool test you can do to see IP Rotate in action is to specify ipchicken.com
as your target. (IPChicken is a website that displays your public IP address, as
seen in Figure 13-11.) Then proxy a request to https://ipchicken.com. Forward
that request and watch how your rotating IP is displayed with every refresh
of https://ipchicken.com.
