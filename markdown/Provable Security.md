Porvable security means to prove that break your crypto is at least as hard as solving another problem known to be hard. *security proof* guarantees that the crypto remains safe as long as the problem remains hard. This type of problem it's called *reduction*. 
Break a cypher is reducible to a method *X* if any method to solve *X* also could break the cypher. The *Proof security* varies to a mathematical and to a cryptographic problems

### Proofs relative to a matheamtical concept
There are as hard as mathematical problem, and are easy to prove once the solution is known to exist, but it's computationally hard to find. **For example** solving a factoarial problem, such as 15 is 3 and 5 becomes harder when we have a number of 3000 bits (900 decimal digits) 
### Proofs relative to another crypto problem
Prove that you could break a crypto problem as you break a similar one. This proofs whether a new scheme is securest than the original one or not, that's the reduction

### Heuristic security
We don't have the absoulut waranty that a cypher system is unbreakable the only thing we do know is that is hard to break, because there were many cryptoanalysist experimented who were hours trying to break it with no succedd.

### Generating keys
Whe you visit a website, you utilize its public key whch is used to establich a symetric key. A key could be generated by these three ways:
- Randomly, using a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) and, when needed, a key-generation algorithm
- From a password, using a key derivation function (KDF), which transforms the user-supplied password into a key
- Through a key agreement protocol, which is a series of message exchanges between two or more parties that ends with the establishment of a shared key
