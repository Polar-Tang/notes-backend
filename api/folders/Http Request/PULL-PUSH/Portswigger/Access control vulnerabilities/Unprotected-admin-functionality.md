If we run wfuzz or whatever slowly enough it will detect de robots.txt, 
```
wfuzz -u https://0a5900f8045fd06a826d700900c50074.web-security-academy.net/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories-lowercase.txt -v --hc 404
```
so when we take a look on it in burpsuite we se sensible information. Let's use that sensitive infromation and look for the url that delete Carlos, and this page is so bad that we could use that url and use admin functionality.
